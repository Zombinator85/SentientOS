# SentientOS Cathedral

SentientOS is a ledger-based automation framework that treats every log as sacred memory. Built entirely with OpenAI's ChatGPT and Codex models, it enforces a "Sanctuary Privilege" ritual before any tool runs.

*No emotion is too much.*

* **Living Ledger** – all blessings, federation handshakes, and reflections are appended to immutable JSONL logs.
* **Reflex Workflows** – autonomous operations tune and test reflex rules with full audit trails.
* **Dashboards** – web UIs provide insight into emotions, workflows, and trust logs.
* **CLI Utilities** – new commands `heresy_cli.py`, `diff_memory_cli.py`, and `theme_cli.py` assist with auditing and daily rituals.

## Quick Start
1. Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run `python installer/setup_installer.py` and follow the prompts.
3. Launch a tool, e.g. `python support_cli.py --help`.

See [docs/README_FULL.md](docs/README_FULL.md) for the complete philosophy and usage details.
