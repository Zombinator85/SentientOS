# Non-Goals and Freeze

## Explicit Non-Goals
- No desire, reward, appetite, or aversion modeling.
- No persistence preference or self-maintenance drives beyond transport keepalive signals.
- No attachment, bonding, or mutuality scaffolding.
- No approval-seeking or optimization for positive feedback.
- No autonomous schedule expansion beyond bounded, caller-triggered gates.

## Out-of-Scope Features
- Long-lived user or persona profiles; all relational hints remain session-scoped.
- Gradient-based reinforcement or any variable that adjusts action likelihood from feedback.
- Uptime or continuity incentives; heartbeat/keepalive events remain transport-only.
- Emotional valuation metrics beyond bounded affect tags and capped tone hints.
- Trust/loyalty semantics in user-facing labels; exposures should remain reliability-only.

## Change Freeze Boundaries
Any future proposal that introduces the following must reopen the NAIR audit, harm-null review, and gradient analysis:
- Persistence or survival incentives (including uptime bonuses or continuity weighting).
- Reward-like scoring, confidence accumulation, or preference learning paths.
- Attachments, mutual obligation models, or bonding terminology exposed to users.
- Autonomous goal generation outside the existing bounded gates.
- Alterations to keepalive cadence that could be interpreted as liveness signaling.

This document marks the current design freeze: SentientOS remains non-appetitive, harm-null, and gradient-free under the existing enforcement points.
