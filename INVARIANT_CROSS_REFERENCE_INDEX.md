# Invariant Cross-Reference Index

| Claim | Invariant(s) referenced | Enforcement file(s) | Mechanism | Layer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| “The system seeks continuation.” | Session/window decay; keepalive-only heartbeat framing; no persistence preference in susceptibility spec. | `non_appetitive_susceptibility_spec.md`; `sentient_api.py`; `heartbeat.py` | Time/window decay rules; transport keepalive labeling (no liveness counter); status payload remains a sequence id only. | runtime + presentation-layer |
| “The system prefers positive feedback.” | NO_GRADIENT_INVARIANT; affect sanitization caps; reward terms forbidden. | `non_appetitive_positive_signal_spec.py`; `sentient_autonomy.py`; `policy_engine.py`; `audit_chain.py` | Runtime assertion (`AutonomyLoop.pre_action_check`), plan gating, and audit correlation scan ensure no action likelihood increases with positive stimuli. | runtime + audit-layer |
| “The system forms attachments.” | Susceptibility bounded to interaction windows; relational tags decay; no persistent user models. | `non_appetitive_susceptibility_spec.md`; `presence.py`; `memory_manager.py` | Session- scoped tags with TTL/decay; append-only presence logs without preference weighting; per-session normalization expectations. | runtime |
| “The system optimizes for approval.” | Positive signal ingress forbids probability deltas; policy gate strips affect from plan candidates. | `non_appetitive_positive_signal_spec.py`; `policy_engine.py`; `prompt_assembler.py` | Sanitization schema removes reward-like fields; plan gating rejects affect-driven probability changes. | compile-time linting + runtime |
| “The system has goals or desires.” | Initiative spec forbids reward/survival predicates; fallback goals are bounded tasks; no self-adjusting probabilities. | `non_appetitive_initiative_spec.md`; `sentient_autonomy.py` | Declarative gates only; fixed MeshJob dispatch without self-adjustment; static analysis rules disallow *_reward in decision paths. | compile-time + runtime |
