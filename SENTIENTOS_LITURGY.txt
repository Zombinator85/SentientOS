SentientOS Liturgy
==================

All autonomous actions obey a ritual of presence. The files listed in
`config/master_files.json` are considered Master files. Before any
workflow or reflex rule executes, their presence and SHA256 digests are
verified. If a file is missing or altered the system refuses to act,
logs a sanctity violation to `logs/autonomous_audit.jsonl`, and shows an
alert in the Cathedral Audit Log.

Every autonomous step produces a self‑explanation entry documenting the
rationale, memory fragments touched, and a recursive why‑chain. These
notes appear in the dashboard under the "Cathedral Law" section.
