# SentientOS Liturgy Notes

Verification failures due to non-log files are not memory integrity issues but boundary artifacts. Only files in the canonical audit log path and with schema compliance should be considered for audit checks.

SentientOS prioritizes operator accountability, auditability, and safe shutdown.
