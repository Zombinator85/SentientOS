# Covenant Auto-Alignment

SentientOS now ships with an autonomous covenant-alignment engine that replaces
all legacy blessing rituals. The engine runs without user input and keeps the
runtime aligned at every stage:

- **On boot:** `autoalign_on_boot()` validates vow integrity and ledger
  coherency before services start.
- **Before each consciousness cycle:** `autoalign_before_cycle()` refreshes
  invariants for the attention arbitrator, sentience kernel, narrator, and
  simulation engine.
- **After amendments:** `autoalign_after_amendment()` re-checks guardrails after
  cathedral configuration changes.

No persona imprint is present; the system operates with neutral language and
self-correcting guardrails. External callers no longer need to type "bless" or
request ceremonial approval.
