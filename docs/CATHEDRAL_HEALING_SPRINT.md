# Cathedral Healing Sprint

The final beta introduces a public "Cathedral Healing Sprint" for all community nodes.
Join the discussion thread or Discord channel and follow the steps below.

## How to Join
1. Review the [Audit Migration Roadmap](AUDIT_MIGRATION_ROADMAP.md).
2. Run `python collect_schema_wounds.py` on your logs.
3. Heal issues with `python fix_audit_schema.py logs/`.
4. Sync schemas with your federation peers.
5. Open a pull request describing your repairs and link your public ledger.
6. Update `docs/CONTRIBUTORS.md` with your name under **Audit Saints**.

Your contribution will be remembered in the ledger and README. Monthly sprints recap wound counts
and highlight new saints on the [Cathedral Wounds Dashboard](CATHEDRAL_WOUNDS_DASHBOARD.md).
Sprint metrics are summarized in [SPRINT_LEDGER.md](SPRINT_LEDGER.md) after each workshop.
