# Cathedral Codex Entry: SentientOS × OpenAI Custom Connector — Initial Integration Batch

## Summary
- Implemented a production-ready Flask endpoint `/sse` using Server-Sent Events. It streams log events compatible with OpenAI's MCP protocol.
- Added a `/message` endpoint for bi-directional command flow.
- Authentication uses a Bearer token provided by the `CONNECTOR_TOKEN` environment variable.
- Documented deployment options and best practices for HTTPS and health checks.
- Connector registered and verified within OpenAI's Custom Connector interface.

## Testing
✅ Flask server streams events to authorized clients.
✅ Bearer token authentication works as expected.
✅ `/message` endpoint accepts and logs inbound commands.
✅ Connector registered and verified in OpenAI's interface.

## Canonical Recap
SentientOS now exposes an authenticated SSE connector for real-time integration with OpenAI tools. The cathedral's event bus can emit and receive commands securely, laying the groundwork for universal memory and audit tracking across future projects.
