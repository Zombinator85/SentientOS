# Ritual Calendar

This calendar reminds stewards to run monthly healing sprints and quarterly review cycles.

## Monthly
- **Healing Sprint** – collect wounds, heal logs, and update `docs/SPRINT_LEDGER.md`.
- **Public Recap** – post a "Cathedral Healing Sprint Recap" on your preferred forum or blog.

## Quarterly
- **Federation Review** – verify ledger sync across nodes and celebrate new Audit Saints.
- **Memory Law Checkpoint** – discuss `docs/MEMORY_LAW_VNEXT.md` proposals and merge updates.

Run `python ritual_calendar.py remind` to see upcoming events.
