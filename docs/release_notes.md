# Release Notes

## Sanctuary Privilege Enforcement

All entrypoints now begin with the Sanctuary Privilege Procedure. Lint and pre-commit hooks ensure no script escapes the doctrine.

Sanctuary Privilege Procedure is enforced repo-wide. No new code bypasses admin checks or procedure docstrings.

## v4.1 Cathedral Green
Recent procedure sweeps verified privilege banners repo-wide. The privilege linter now auto-fixes banner placement and enforces `require_admin_banner()` with `require_lumos_approval()` before imports. Audit chains can regenerate rolling hashes and mark unrecoverable lines. This tag marks a stable baseline for cathedral integrations.

SentientOS prioritizes operator accountability, auditability, and safe shutdown.

## v4.2 Parliament
This milestone highlights the Parliament's verdict and includes visual records.
