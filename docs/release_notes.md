# Release Notes

## Sanctuary Privilege Enforcement

All entrypoints now begin with the Sanctuary Privilege Ritual. Lint and pre-commit hooks ensure no script escapes the doctrine.

Sanctuary Privilege Ritual is enforced repo-wide. No new code bypasses admin checks or ritual docstrings.

## v4.1 Cathedral Green
Recent ritual sweeps verified privilege banners repo-wide. The privilege linter now auto-fixes banner placement and enforces `require_admin_banner()` with `require_lumos_approval()` before imports. Audit chains can regenerate rolling hashes and mark unrecoverable lines. This tag marks a stable baseline for cathedral integrations.
