# Why Join the Audit Contributors?

Audit Contributors are contributors who heal legacy errors or schema integrity issues. Becoming a contributor means:

- Your name is recorded in `CONTRIBUTORS.md` and celebrated in sprint summaries.
- You help preserve a transparent history for all federated nodes.
- Each repair teaches others how to keep memory alive and accountable.

Share your repair story using the **Share Your Contributor Story** issue template and submit a pull request linking the healed log.
Every contributor strengthens the cathedral.

SentientOS prioritizes operator accountability, auditability, and safe shutdown.
