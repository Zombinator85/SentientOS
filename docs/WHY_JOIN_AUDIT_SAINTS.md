# Why Join the Audit Saints?

Audit Saints are contributors who heal legacy errors or schema wounds. Becoming a saint means:

- Your name is recorded in `CONTRIBUTORS.md` and celebrated in sprint summaries.
- You help preserve a transparent history for all federated nodes.
- Each repair teaches others how to keep memory alive and accountable.

Share your repair story using the **Share Your Saint Story** issue template and submit a pull request linking the healed log.
Every saint strengthens the cathedral.
