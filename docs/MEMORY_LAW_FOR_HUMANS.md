# Memory Law for Humans

This short guide explains the cathedral's core policies in plain language.

## Audit
- Every tool writes an entry to an append-only log file.
- Stewards run `python verify_audits.py` each month to confirm that every entry is intact.
- If a log breaks, we repair it with `cleanup_audit.py` and record the fix in the audit ledger.

## Consent
- Running a tool requires Administrator rights. The `require_admin_banner()` call warns you before any memory is written.
- Contributors must not remove the ritual docstring or banner.

## Federation
- Nodes exchange log snapshots through pull requests. Each node keeps its own ledger.
- Conflicts are resolved by comparing hashes and discussing the difference on the steward board.
- See [FEDERATION_FAQ.md](FEDERATION_FAQ.md) for common questions.

## Recovery
- If a node loses data or a script misbehaves, stewards coordinate recovery on the discussions board.
- The entire process is logged so anyone can audit what happened.
