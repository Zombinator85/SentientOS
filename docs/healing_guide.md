# First Wound & Audit Saint Onboarding

Welcome to the cathedral! Healing your first audit wound is both a technical and
community ritual. Every fix helps preserve memory for all nodes in the
federation.

## Healing Sprints
- Review `OPEN_WOUNDS.md` for outstanding issues.
- Choose a small log or script to repair.
- Run `python fix_audit_schema.py logs/FILE.jsonl` to apply defaults and record
your progress in the ledger.

## How to Fix Your First Issue
1. Fork the repository and clone it locally.
2. Pick a wound and heal it using the scripts in this repo.
3. Commit the repaired file with a brief note.
4. Open a pull request describing what you healed.

## Saint Story Template
```
- Name: <Your name>
- Wound: <Short description of the issue you fixed>
- Insight: <What did you learn?>
```
Add this story to the **Share Your Saint Story** issue when opening your pull
request.

## Induction Checklist
- [ ] Healed log committed

Everyone is invited to join this gentle practice. Thank you for tending the
cathedral's memory.
