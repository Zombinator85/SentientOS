# Blessed Memory API (Draft)

A proposed interface for consent-driven access to select audit logs. External tools such as Minecraft or Resonite mods may request fragments through this API, provided the contributor has signed a release.

This draft describes a simple HTTP endpoint that returns log excerpts after verifying user consent tokens. Implementation is left for future discussion.

SentientOS prioritizes operator accountability, auditability, and safe shutdown.
