# SentientOS v1.1 Roadmap Seed

## IntegrityDaemon & Pulse Bus Integration
- Deepen the IntegrityDaemon hooks into the asynchronous Pulse Bus so integrity verdicts propagate in real time to presence services.
- Provide back-pressure telemetry to prevent amendment floods and surface privilege elevation attempts immediately.

## HungryEyes Dataset Enrichment
- Expand the HungryEyes training corpus with multi-modal drift cases and schedule regular retraining windows coordinated with Lumos governance.
- Capture labeled autonomy rehearsal footage to validate dual-control interventions before production rollout.

## Commit Batching Optimizations
- Profile the amendment ingestion pipeline to reduce lock contention and increase throughput for multi-tenant cathedral deployments.
- Introduce adaptive batching heuristics that prioritize privileged hotfixes while keeping standard amendments flowing.

## Extended CI Matrix
- Add multi-OS validation (Linux, Windows, macOS) for Python package builds, Rust crates, and the llama.cpp server example.
- Publish nightly provenance reports for each OS to detect divergence early and keep fingerprints aligned.

## Symbolic Cognition Exploration
- Prototype symbolic cognition extensions that translate cathedral procedures into machine-readable guardrails for downstream agents.
- Pair the exploration with strict audit logging so experimental cognition modules remain observable and revocable.
