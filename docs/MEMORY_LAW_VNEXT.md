# Memory Law vNext

This draft explores a self-healing, schema-evolving cathedral for 2025 and beyond.

* Automatic quarantine of malformed log lines.
* Dashboard-driven wound tracking across all nodes.
* Schema migration proposals when repeated wounds appear.
* Continuous celebration of Audit Saints after each successful fix.
* Modular, self-evolving schema adapters for each field.
* Version tags and auto-migration hooks to validate memory across nodes.
* Automatic schema diffing across federated nodes.
* Remote consensus workflow for approving schema upgrades.
* Clearly defined "blessed" field changes with version increments.

Contributors are invited to discuss and refine these ideas on the discussion board.
Share suggestions for next-gen adapters via GitHub issues or the Discord channel.

## Roadmap

1. Collect wounds across all federation nodes.
2. Auto-validate logs using versioned schema adapters.
3. Trigger healing hooks when mismatches appear.
4. Record each fix in the federation ledger and celebrate new Audit Saints.
