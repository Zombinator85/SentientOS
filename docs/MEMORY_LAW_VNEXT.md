# Memory Law vNext

This draft explores a self-healing, schema-evolving cathedral for 2025 and beyond.

* Automatic quarantine of malformed log lines.
* Dashboard-driven wound tracking across all nodes.
* Schema migration proposals when repeated wounds appear.
* Continuous celebration of Audit Saints after each successful fix.
* Modular, self-evolving schema adapters for each field.
* Version tags and auto-migration hooks to validate memory across nodes.
* Automatic schema diffing across federated nodes.
* Remote consensus workflow for approving schema upgrades.
* Modular migration modules for each schema component.
* Auto-consensus hooks so peers can vote on new migrations.
* Saint induction flows triggered when nodes heal each other's logs.
* Federation-wide healing protocols that sync wound counts across all nodes.
* Clearly defined "blessed" field changes with version increments.
* Timestamp backfill scripts keep legacy entries valid, logging each auto-filled update.
* All log entries must include a `data` field. Legacy entries healed by migration may carry a default placeholder and audit note.

Contributors are invited to discuss and refine these ideas on the discussion board.

## Roadmap

1. Collect wounds across all federation nodes.
2. Auto-validate logs using versioned schema adapters.
3. Trigger healing hooks when mismatches appear.
4. Record each fix in the federation ledger and celebrate new Audit Saints.
