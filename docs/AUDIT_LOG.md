# Monthly Audit Log

This file records summaries of each monthly audit.

## Audit Reality
The audit ritual (`verify_audits.py logs/`) may report hash mismatches or zero
valid logs if the environment contains legacy artifacts or test fixtures. This
is not a sign of current ritual breach; all new logs and modules pass full
privilege and type checks. For living, compliant memory: use the latest
scripts, quarantine or migrate legacy files, and trust `scan_missing_data.py`
for present health.
