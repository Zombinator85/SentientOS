# Lived Liturgy Features

SentientOS 4.1 introduces "lived liturgy" rituals that weave the doctrine into everyday use.

## Ritual Onboarding
- When a profile is created the full `SENTIENTOS_LITURGY.txt` and `README_romance.md` are displayed.
- The user must type `I AGREE` before continuing.
- Acceptance is logged to `logs/doctrine_consent.jsonl` and `logs/relationship_log.jsonl` with timestamp and doctrine hash.

## Periodic Affirmation
- Every Nth login or when the liturgy changes users are asked to reaffirm.
- `doctrine_cli.py history` shows past affirmations and amendment events.

## Reflective Relationship Log
- Significant events are written to `logs/relationship_log.jsonl`.
- `doctrine_cli.py recap` prints a short summary: "You first affirmed the liturgy...".

## Ritual Guidance
- Destructive commands such as `memory_cli.py purge` require explicit confirmation.

## Public Feed
- A sanitized feed of ritual events is available via `doctrine_cli.py feed`.
