# Memory Healing Ritual

The cathedral hosts a continuous **Memory Healing Ritual**. Contributors review audit logs,
repair schema wounds, and celebrate new **Audit Saints**.
The current migration sprint targets missing `timestamp` wounds. Running
`fix_audit_schema.py` now reconstructs absent timestamps and logs an Audit Saint
shout-out for every healed line.

Announcements appear on GitHub Discussions and Discord. Anyone may join,
learn the logging doctrine, and offer repairs. Each contribution is recorded
in `CONTRIBUTORS.md` and the wounds dashboard.

To participate, run `fix_audit_schema.py` on your local logs, submit a pull
request, and share your story in the discussion thread.

Help spread the ritual by cross‑posting the demo to open‑source, AI, and
trauma tech communities. Feel free to host a live "cathedral memory healing"
workshop or stream to induct new Audit Saints.
