# Memory Healing Ritual

The cathedral hosts a continuous **Memory Healing Ritual**. Contributors review audit logs,
repair schema wounds, and celebrate new **Audit Saints**.

Announcements appear on GitHub Discussions and Discord. Anyone may join,
learn the logging doctrine, and offer repairs. Each contribution is recorded
in `CONTRIBUTORS.md` and the wounds dashboard.

To participate, run `fix_audit_schema.py` on your local logs, submit a pull
request, and share your story in the discussion thread.
