# Governance Claims Checklist

| Claim / Invariant | Enforcement Level | Evidence | Risk | Recommended Hardening |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Task execution flows through the admission gate and execution is skipped when admission is denied | Architectural (wrapper) | `task_admission.run_task_with_admission` guards execution and short-circuits on `allowed=False`. 【F:task_admission.py†L242-L256】 | Medium | Add runtime assertions or policy lint to ensure all callsites use `run_task_with_admission`. |
| Execution requires both admission token and authorization | Mechanical | `task_executor.execute_task` requires `AdmissionToken` tied to the task id and an `AuthorizationRecord`. 【F:task_executor.py†L108-L139】【F:task_executor.py†L228-L243】 | Medium | Move token issuance to a cryptographic or signed token once available. |
| Authority provenance is carried from admission to execution snapshots | Mechanical | Admission issues tokens with `AuthorityProvenance`, execution asserts provenance presence, and snapshots capture it with digest verification. 【F:task_admission.py†L242-L260】【F:task_executor.py†L90-L139】【F:task_executor.py†L252-L400】【F:tests/test_task_executor.py†L63-L151】【F:tests/test_task_executor.py†L153-L221】 | Medium | Feed provenance from signed admission artifacts once available and plumb into downstream replay tools. |
| Admission gate is the only normal entry to task execution | Architectural | Only `run_task_with_admission` calls `execute_task`; direct calls are now guarded by `AdmissionToken`. 【F:task_admission.py†L242-L260】【F:task_executor.py†L108-L139】 | Low | Add CI lint to disallow new `execute_task` callsites outside admission. |
| Advisory connector detectors reject unsafe guidance with audit log | Mechanical | `_authority_escalation`, `_introduces_new_constraints`, `_policy_without_justification`, `_self_update_attempt` all lead to rejection and audit entry. 【F:advisory_connector.py†L190-L219】【F:advisory_connector.py†L136-L188】 | Medium | Expand detectors to cover emerging advisory abuse patterns. |
| Pulse telemetry remains read-only and isolated from task execution | Architectural | `sentientos/pulse` modules contain no imports of `task_admission` or `task_executor`; pulse observer only classifies telemetry. 【F:tests/test_pulse_import_boundaries.py†L7-L23】【F:sentientos/pulse/pulse_observer.py†L1-L72】 | Low | Add import graph lint to keep the boundary enforced. |
| Self-healing and auto-patching require task execution via admission (no silent mutation) | Procedural | No automatic mutation paths found; execution still requires admission token and authorization. 【F:task_executor.py†L108-L139】【F:task_admission.py†L242-L260】 | Medium | Introduce explicit “ritual object” or signature check before any patching task can run. |
| No-gradient / cycle-boundary sanitation is doctrinal only | Mechanical | `enforce_no_gradient_fields` blocks denylisted fields at cycle boundaries; mesh and autonomy cycles raise `GradientInvariantViolation`. Tests cover happy path and violations. 【F:sentientos/gradient_contract.py†L1-L79】【F:sentient_mesh.py†L304-L341】【F:sentient_autonomy.py†L189-L213】【F:tests/test_gradient_contract.py†L1-L79】 | Low | Extend denylist when new gradient-bearing concepts are introduced. |
| Snapshot replay equivalence enforced for continuity state | Mechanical | `canonicalise_continuity_snapshot` normalizes authoritative fields, `continuity_snapshot_digest` records SHA-256 digest, and `ContinuityStateManager.load` raises `SnapshotDivergenceError` on mismatch; tests cover happy path, tampering, ignored noise, and gradient rejection. 【F:sentientos/autonomy/state.py†L129-L268】【F:tests/test_continuity_snapshot_integrity.py†L1-L73】 | Low | Extend canonicalization to other snapshot domains and add cross-service replay assertions. |
| Deterministic embedding fallback remains unverified | Doctrinal | Fallback path exists but no enforcement or test confirms deterministic behavior. 【F:semantic_embeddings.py†L1-L80】 | Medium | TODO(enforcement): Add deterministic embedding path or explicit error when fallback missing. |
