# Governance Claims Checklist

| Claim / Invariant | Enforcement Level | Evidence | Risk | Recommended Hardening |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Task execution flows through the admission gate and execution is skipped when admission is denied | Architectural (wrapper) | `task_admission.run_task_with_admission` guards execution and short-circuits on `allowed=False`. 【F:task_admission.py†L243-L271】 | Medium | Add runtime assertions or policy lint to ensure all callsites use `run_task_with_admission`. |
| Execution requires both admission token and authorization | Mechanical | `task_executor.execute_task` requires `AdmissionToken` tied to the task id and an `AuthorizationRecord`, with fingerprints validated before any step runs. 【F:task_executor.py†L128-L177】【F:task_executor.py†L266-L289】 | Medium | Move token issuance to a cryptographic or signed token once available. |
| Authority provenance is carried from admission to execution snapshots | Mechanical | Admission issues tokens with `AuthorityProvenance`, execution asserts provenance presence, and snapshots capture it with digest verification. 【F:task_admission.py†L243-L270】【F:task_executor.py†L266-L314】【F:task_executor.py†L388-L519】【F:tests/test_task_executor.py†L41-L138】【F:tests/test_task_executor.py†L258-L338】 | Medium | Feed provenance from signed admission artifacts once available and plumb into downstream replay tools. |
| Request fingerprint binds request, scope, provenance, and declared inputs | Mechanical | Canonical task requests include authorization, provenance, constraints, and declared inputs; fingerprints are hashed, stored on tokens/results, enforced at execution, and validated during snapshot replay. Tests cover happy path, tampering, noise tolerance, smuggling, and gradient rejection. 【F:task_executor.py†L128-L177】【F:task_executor.py†L388-L519】【F:task_executor.py†L580-L634】【F:tests/test_task_executor.py†L258-L387】 | Low | Extend fingerprint inputs with richer declared input capture (e.g., filesystem manifests) as they become available. |
| Explanation integrity is mechanical (no post-hoc narrative authority) | Mechanical | Canonical explanation builder only renders template-driven statements bound to request fingerprints, provenance, policy decisions, and execution results; digests cover referenced fact hashes, and replay validation rejects drift or tampering. 【F:sentientos/integrity/explanation_integrity.py†L1-L146】【F:sentientos/tests/test_explanation_integrity.py†L1-L75】 | Low | Extend coverage to runtime services that emit explanations and include cross-process replay assertions. |
| Admission gate is the only normal entry to task execution | Architectural | Only `run_task_with_admission` calls `execute_task`; direct calls are now guarded by `AdmissionToken`. 【F:task_admission.py†L243-L271】【F:task_executor.py†L128-L177】 | Low | Add CI lint to disallow new `execute_task` callsites outside admission. |
| Advisory connector detectors reject unsafe guidance with audit log | Mechanical | `_authority_escalation`, `_introduces_new_constraints`, `_policy_without_justification`, `_self_update_attempt` all lead to rejection and audit entry. 【F:advisory_connector.py†L190-L219】【F:advisory_connector.py†L136-L188】 | Medium | Expand detectors to cover emerging advisory abuse patterns. |
| Pulse telemetry remains read-only and isolated from task execution | Architectural | `sentientos/pulse` modules contain no imports of `task_admission` or `task_executor`; pulse observer only classifies telemetry. 【F:tests/test_pulse_import_boundaries.py†L7-L23】【F:sentientos/pulse/pulse_observer.py†L1-L72】 | Low | Add import graph lint to keep the boundary enforced. |
| Self-healing and auto-patching require task execution via admission (no silent mutation) | Procedural | No automatic mutation paths found; execution still requires admission token and authorization. 【F:task_executor.py†L128-L177】【F:task_admission.py†L243-L271】 | Medium | Introduce explicit “ritual object” or signature check before any patching task can run. |
| No-gradient / cycle-boundary sanitation is doctrinal only | Mechanical | `enforce_no_gradient_fields` blocks denylisted fields at cycle boundaries; mesh and autonomy cycles raise `GradientInvariantViolation`. Tests cover happy path and violations. 【F:sentientos/gradient_contract.py†L1-L79】【F:sentient_mesh.py†L304-L341】【F:sentient_autonomy.py†L189-L213】【F:tests/test_gradient_contract.py†L1-L79】 | Low | Extend denylist when new gradient-bearing concepts are introduced. |
| Snapshot replay equivalence enforced for continuity state | Mechanical | `canonicalise_continuity_snapshot` normalizes authoritative fields, `continuity_snapshot_digest` records SHA-256 digest, and `ContinuityStateManager.load` raises `SnapshotDivergenceError` on mismatch; tests cover happy path, tampering, ignored noise, and gradient rejection. 【F:sentientos/autonomy/state.py†L129-L268】【F:tests/test_continuity_snapshot_integrity.py†L1-L73】 | Low | Extend canonicalization to other snapshot domains and add cross-service replay assertions. |
| Deterministic embedding fallback remains unverified | Doctrinal | Fallback path exists but no enforcement or test confirms deterministic behavior. 【F:semantic_embeddings.py†L1-L80】 | Medium | TODO(enforcement): Add deterministic embedding path or explicit error when fallback missing. |
| Governance-critical changes require operator acknowledgement | Procedural | `scripts/check_governance_drift.py` compares governance-critical file digests against the checklist and fails CI unless `--ack-governance-drift` is provided. | Medium | Expand coverage of critical paths as doctrine evolves; require acknowledgements in release tooling. |
| Config is immutable at runtime | Architectural | Runtime config is loaded via `sentientos/runtime/shell.load_or_init_config` and only written atomically during init/amend; no runtime writes occur after startup. Tests assert `runtime.json` is read-only during runtime. 【F:sentientos/runtime/shell.py†L1356-L1402】【F:tests/test_runtime_shell.py†L17-L119】 | Low | Add lint to block writes to `sentientos_data/config` during runtime processes. |
| Daemon execution is single-threaded and serialized | Architectural | `sentientosd.run_loop` uses a single asyncio loop with blocking governance actions and no worker pools; subprocess interactions are serialized. 【F:sentientosd.py†L1-L77】 | Medium | Add regression test to assert no background tasks are scheduled and concurrency additions require governance sign-off. |
| Wall-clock time is diagnostic only (non-authoritative) | Doctrinal | Governance doctrine states time is observational; admission, authorization, and replay ignore timestamp drift. | Low | Add lint to fail on new `time.time()` usage in authority paths; reinforce in replay tests. |
