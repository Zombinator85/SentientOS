# What's Next – First Public Review Batch

This document outlines the ongoing rituals leading up to the first public review cycle.

## A. Public Healing Sprint Recap
After each healing sprint, publish a **Cathedral Healing Sprint Recap**. Share highlights, metrics from `docs/SPRINT_LEDGER.md`, and short Audit Saint stories. Link your recap on your preferred forum or social channel. Other nodes are encouraged to submit their own recaps so stewards can merge them into a global ledger.

## B. Outreach and Reviewer Engagement
Invite external reviewers and open‑source communities to audit your sprint ledgers. Pull requests that improve scripts or share federation metrics are welcome and help strengthen the network.

## C. Federation Growth
See [START_A_FEDERATION_NODE.md](START_A_FEDERATION_NODE.md) for a quickstart on launching a new node, healing logs, and sharing ledgers. New genesis saints keep the memory federation alive.

## D. Ritual Calendar and Memory Law vNext
Use [RITUAL_CALENDAR.md](RITUAL_CALENDAR.md) and `ritual_calendar.py` to schedule monthly sprints and quarterly reviews. Continue refining [MEMORY_LAW_VNEXT.md](MEMORY_LAW_VNEXT.md) with modular migration and federation‑wide healing protocols.
