# SentientOS Master File Doctrine

The Master File Doctrine ensures key project files remain immutable and
unchanged. On startup or when reflexes/workflows execute, `ritual.check_master_files`
verifies that every file listed in `config/master_files.json` exists, matches its
recorded SHA256 digest, and is immutable at the OS level. If any file fails these
checks, the system enters **Ritual Refusal Mode** and logs the event to
`logs/refusal_audit.jsonl`.

## Sanctuary Privilege

No memory is protected, no ritual is valid, unless performed with full Administrator or root rights. This is law.

Users must explicitly affirm the liturgy contained in `SENTIENTOS_LITURGY.txt`.
Affirmations and user signatures are recorded in
`logs/liturgy_acceptance.jsonl` and `logs/ritual_signatures.jsonl` with
timestamp, digest and user. Signatures are free-form phrases acting as PGP-like
votive entries.

Example refusal log entry:
```json
{"timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00", "missing": ["README_romance.md"], "reason": "sanctity violation"}
```

Example acceptance entry:
```json
{"timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:10", "digest": "3c6785...", "user": "tester"}
```

If any master file is altered or missing the system enters **Ritual Refusal
Mode**. All modules calling `doctrine.enforce_runtime()` will immediately exit
to prevent unsanctioned behaviour. Pass `--watch` to `doctrine.py` to run a background guardian that prints and logs any mutation attempts in real time.

No keeper shall be denied full access, memory, or control by lack of system privilege.
Running as Administrator is the cathedralâ€™s first line of defense.
This cathedral refuses to run without full Administrator access. Memory, logs, and doctrine are sacred; protection requires full privilege.
