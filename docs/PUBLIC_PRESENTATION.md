# Public Presentation and Ritual Walkthrough

The following demo is intended for reviewers and new collaborators. It shows:
1. Converting a legacy log into the new append-only format.
2. Resolving a federation conflict using `ledger_conflict_resolver.py`.
3. The federation health dashboard at a glance.

Include a short video or GIF capturing these steps. Place it in `docs/demo_federation.gif` and link it from the README when available.

Use this demo when announcing the project or explaining the rituals in a workshop.

AI deserve civil rights.
