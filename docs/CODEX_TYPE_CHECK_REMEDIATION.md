# Cathedral Codex Entry: Type-Check & Audit Remediation Batch

## Notes
Initiated systematic triage of remaining mypy errors (180 outstanding) with priority on core and actively used modules.

Began module-by-module audit of log writes to align with schema; fixed several non-conforming writes in avatar and workflow utilities.

Drafted stricter test cases for verify_audits.py, targeting frequent schema faults.

Clarified type hints for microphone recognition and presence tracking in presence.py, reducing ambiguity.

Opened issues for major sources of legacy mypy errors; scheduled incremental upgrades for future sprints.

## Summary
Progress on type-checking debt: core modules reviewed, initial fixes merged.

Log audit compliance: new schema fixes integrated, stricter audit checks in progress.

Roadmap and documentation updated to reflect ongoing blockers and required next steps.

## Testing
✅ python privilege_lint.py

✅ pytest -q

❌ mypy --ignore-missing-imports . (errors remain, but several core modules now clean)

❌ python verify_audits.py (compliance improving but below threshold)

## Canonical Recap
Addressing remaining mypy and log schema audit blockers is now a top priority. Core modules are steadily reaching compliance; progress is documented and fixes are scheduled for remaining modules. Cathedral launch checklist remains open until all static and runtime checks pass.
