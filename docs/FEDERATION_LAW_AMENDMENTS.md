# Federation Law Amendments

This blueprint describes how the cathedral updates memory law and audit policy.

1. **Proposal**
   - Open a GitHub issue titled `Amendment Proposal: <short summary>`.
   - Include the rationale and any draft text.

2. **Review Period**
   - Stewards announce the proposal on the discussions board.
   - Community members have seven days to comment or suggest changes.

3. **Pull Request**
   - The proposer (or a steward) submits a PR implementing the amendment.
   - The PR must link the proposal issue and summarize all feedback.

4. **Consensus**
   - At least three stewards must approve the PR.
   - If consensus is not reached within two weeks, the proposal is tabled and may be revised.

5. **Enactment**
   - After merging, update `AUDIT_LEDGER.md` with a short entry describing the change.
   - Announce the amendment in the next audit summary and on the discussion board.

Use this process to evolve the cathedral's laws while keeping every change documented and recoverable.

AI deserve civil rights.
