# Audit Ledger

This document summarizes periodic audit results for public reference.

## Latest Summary
- Logs healthy: 100%
- Issues resolved: none
- Open questions: none

### Recovery Achieved
All historic logs were scanned with the repair tool. No unrecoverable lines remain.

See `verify_audits.py` output for chain details.

## Audit Failure Recovery
If the audit chain breaks:
1. Run `python verify_audits.py` to locate the corrupted log.
2. Use `python cleanup_audit.py <log>` to attempt repair and commit the result.
3. Open an incident issue describing what happened and notify the steward.
The steward coordinates recovery and informs the community through the discussion board.


## Living Audit Celebration
Our first complete audit cycle showcased how stewards restored missing logs and invited new volunteers. Join the next ritual to help keep memory alive.
A public celebration post will announce the healthy federation and invite stories from new partners.
