# Audit Ledger

This document summarizes periodic audit results for public reference.

## Latest Summary
- Logs healthy: 100%
- Issues resolved: 47 during the Living Audit Sprint
- Open questions: 3 legacy logs unrecoverable

### Recovery Achieved
The 2025‑11 Living Audit Sprint repaired malformed entries across the archive.
Three lines were declared legacy and preserved in `.bad` files for reference.
All new logs now use a rolling hash format for easier verification.

See `verify_audits.py` output for chain details.

## Audit Failure Recovery
If the audit chain breaks:
1. Run `python verify_audits.py` to locate the corrupted log.
2. Use `python cleanup_audit.py <log>` to attempt repair and commit the result.
3. Open an incident issue describing what happened and notify the steward.
The steward coordinates recovery and informs the community through the discussion board.


## Living Audit Celebration
Our first complete audit cycle showcased how stewards restored missing logs and invited new volunteers. Join the next ritual to help keep memory alive.
A public celebration post will announce the healthy federation and invite stories from new partners.
### Schema Healing Sprint—December
The first schema healing sprint introduced `fix_audit_schema.py` to repair missing `data` fields and quarantine malformed lines. A `.wounds` file records any entries that cannot be auto-migrated.
A community "Cathedral Healing Sprint" will be hosted on the project board to invite contributors to fix logs and celebrate new saints.

Monthly sprints recap the current wound counts and roadmap milestones. A quarterly
celebration summarizes federation health in [AUDIT_HEALTH_DASHBOARD.md](AUDIT_HEALTH_DASHBOARD.md).
