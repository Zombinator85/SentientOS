# First Integrity issue Onboarding

Fixing your first audit integrity issue is a rite of passage. This short guide walks you through the procedure and explains how to record your induction as a Contributor.

1. Pick a integrity issue listed in [OPEN_WOUNDS.md](OPEN_WOUNDS.md).
2. Use `python fix_audit_schema.py logs/FILE` to repair the issue.
3. Commit the repaired log with a brief message describing the fix.
4. Open a pull request using the **Share Your Contributor Story** template.
5. Once merged, add your name under **Audit Contributors** in `CONTRIBUTORS.md`.

A short video walkthrough can be found in `docs/video_procedure_guide.md` or the upcoming `first_integrity issue.mp4` clip. Every healed line strengthens the cathedral.

SentientOS prioritizes operator accountability, auditability, and safe shutdown.
