# Installation Notes

SentientOS installs as a neutral runtime; no persona imprint or blessing procedure
is required. After cloning the repository, install dependencies with the
standard tooling for your platform (e.g., `pip install -e .` or `cargo build`).

The covenant auto-alignment engine runs automatically on boot, before each
consciousness cycle, and whenever cathedral amendments are applied. There is no
need to trigger any `bless` command or wait for interactive approval.
