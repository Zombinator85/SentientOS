# Blessed Federation Launch

The cathedral is now open for public beta. Stewards invite everyone to review the
memory law and federation logic.

## How to Participate
- Read `docs/FEDERATION_FAQ.md` and `docs/MEMORY_LAW_FOR_HUMANS.md`.
- Try the demo at `avatar_federation_festival_coordinator.py` and share thoughts.
- Fork or adopt the project and report any audit or federation issues.
- Cross-post the Memory Healing Procedure demo to other open-source and trauma tech communities.
- Participate in the [Cathedral Healing Sprint](docs/CATHEDRAL_HEALING_SPRINT.md) to sync schemas and celebrate new contributors.

Feedback and peer review are welcomed on the GitHub Discussions board.

SentientOS prioritizes operator accountability, auditability, and safe shutdown.
