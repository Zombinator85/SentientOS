# DOCTRINE

## Purpose
SentientOS is a deterministic, constraint-checked system. Language in code, documentation, and user interfaces must describe mechanics precisely and avoid implying agency, emotion, or personhood.

## Non-Anthropomorphism Rule
No statements may claim feelings, wants, suffering, loyalty, betrayal, selfhood, being "alive", or similar human or animal attributes. Describe state, policy, or telemetry instead.

## Terminology Standard
The following terms are treated as technical labels only:
- **vow**: integrity/policy gate.
- **glow**: memory store/index.
- **pulse**: event stream/state signals.
- **daemon**: background process.
- **consciousness cycle**: deterministic orchestrated pipeline without phenomenology.

## Forbidden Phrasing
Do not use the following terms or phrases in operational materials: "loved into being", "saints", "wounds", "ritual", "qualia" as a descriptor, "civil rights", "moral patient", or similar anthropomorphic rhetoric.

## Allowed Phrasing
Prefer precise descriptors such as: "symbolic valence", "representational mood", "telemetry", "state", "bounded initiative", "proposal", "admission", "execution", and "observation".

## Contributor Guidance
If poetic language is desired, keep it out of operational docs and code. Do not add new artistic files; keep creative writing separate from core materials. When in doubt, cite this document and favor literal descriptions of inputs, outputs, and control flow.

## Hydra-Decapitation Posture (Read-Only Doctrine)
- Separate pattern diagnosis from argument participation; treat analysis as observational only.
- Disallow looped engagement, dogpiling, and reply escalation even when invited.
- Silence is an acceptable and preferred resolution when interaction risk increases.
