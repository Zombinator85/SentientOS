# SentientOS long construction continuation

Non-authorizing progress record. Construction changes are **untested and unverified for production**. Branch: `codex/construct-sentientos`.

## Latest remotely verified checkpoint

GitHub branch inspection most recently verified `cab9082d24eec7c98eed29a1e6997370971fd3c3` (tree `1f6f946be36e4aae40fb9f269010df47c9a1708c`, parent `3284f43510f9132a1de8f3e7a592527817925163`). Local Git `HEAD` is historical and is not the remote branch identity. Continue with GitHub Git-data commits plus compare-and-swap ref publication.

## Current constructed connections

- Windows has an import-safe `flock` facade, reparse-safe bounded custody readers, and an installation-scoped read-only view. The view derives the fixed machine root from installation identity, validates it by held Windows handles and exposes no write or lock methods. POSIX mutation behavior remains unchanged.
- Windows daemon recovery can read the exact configured resident model-transition protocol and journal. A separate transition-custody inspector verifies request packets, bounded receipt chains and journal references without consuming a packet, appending a receipt, retrying a stage, or invoking inference. Process transition remains POSIX-only.
- Successor software and model-replacement readers preserve canonical identities, bounded evidence and incomplete/interrupted posture. Reconstructing an interrupted model replacement does not replay its inference endpoint.
- World-State has an explicit proposal-review projection; a new fulfillment-receipt bridge now additionally binds the full v2 receipt, preserves proposal/review/handoff references, rejects duplicate identity conflicts, and emits only a digest-bound fulfillment claim. It marks receipt creation time separately from effect time and asserts no authority or actual effect.
- The projection config accepts the existing v1/v2 selections and a v3 explicit fulfillment selection. The daemon re-reads selected receipts on each board build, reports degraded/missing/omitted selections, and makes verified historical claims available to existing configured epistemic and later-tick self-model paths as interpretation, with unknown freshness.
- Strategy proposal records now distinguish the invocation request's experiment linkage from authenticated resource-allocation linkage carried by the invocation receipt. The resident World-State builder joins selected proposal records to the separate resource-ledger record by invocation, allocation, attempt, consumption-receipt and effect-receipt identity, checks principal binding and ledger completeness, and emits a bounded historical lineage record. Missing or conflicting selected custody is degraded; legacy unlinked invocations remain unlinked. The joined lineage is prioritized for later resident cognition and carried into review/self-model interpretation as lineage, not consequence or objective.
- Successor-generation recovery now uses handle-bound known-path reads for Windows presence checks instead of `Path.exists()` on generation and receipt artifacts. Read-only `inspect()` exposes an incomplete handoff with its bounded pending phase; start and mutation remain blocked without POSIX flock support.
- Earlier local construction continues to harden epistemic state, developmental history, resource evidence, admission, and invocation recovery. Writes stay fail-closed where equivalent atomic Windows publication and custody are unavailable.

## Verification and limits

Changed Python files compile and `git diff --check` passes. No pytest, mypy, runtime execution, Windows execution, provider/model activation, real-world observation, or production verification was performed. Cross-platform installation-backed mutation, activation, serving, transition execution and atomic publication remain unsupported. The fulfillment receipt is a fulfiller claim only; it does not demonstrate that an external action occurred. Current embodied independent-observation input still lacks an authenticated observer issuer. The resource-proposal join and Windows artifact reads are source-implemented but not runtime exercised; the resource join is bounded to the configured projected ledger tail.

## Next executable task

Next, inspect whether existing authenticated causal evidence owners can bind persisted prediction comparisons to an admitted epistemic mutation. Current embodied observations are caller assertions and must stay historical/contextual; do not make them satisfy independent evidence rules. Continue closing exact transition/recovery owner handoffs in the meanwhile.
