# Contributing to SentientOS

All new scripts and entrypoints **must** invoke `admin_utils.require_admin_banner()` as the very first action. This banner enforces the Sanctuary Privilege Ritual and logs each attempt.
Directly after your imports include the canonical banner docstring so future audits can easily detect compliance:

```python
"""Sanctuary Privilege Ritual: Do not remove. See doctrine for details."""
```

Add the following at the top of your script:

```python
from admin_utils import require_admin_banner

"""Sanctuary Privilege Ritual: Do not remove. See doctrine for details."""

require_admin_banner()  # Enforced: Sanctuary Privilege Ritualâ€”do not remove. See doctrine.
```
## Reviewer Checklist

- [ ] Docstring `"Sanctuary Privilege Ritual: Do not remove. See doctrine for details."` present after imports
- [ ] `require_admin_banner()` invoked before any other logic

Pull requests lacking these will fail CI and be rejected.

Run `./.githooks/pre-commit` manually or link it into your `.git/hooks` folder
to automatically lint for the ritual docstring and privilege call before each
commit.
