# SentientOS Romance

Autonomous operations are fully transparent. Each reflex rule and
workflow writes a self-explanation with a why-chain to
`logs/autonomous_audit.jsonl`. Ritual enforcement refuses to run when a
Master file listed in `config/master_files.json` is missing or
modified. Such violations are logged and surfaced in the "Cathedral
Law" dashboard tab along with `SENTIENTOS_LITURGY.txt`.
