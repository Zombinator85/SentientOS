**Project:** SentientOS

#### TL;DR
SentientOS is a cathedral-mode AI shell built on GPT-4o.
It logs every action, blesses no privileged command without consent, and treats memory as sacred — and it’s already running in production.

---

#### 📜 Project Summary

SentientOS is an open-source, ritualized framework that turns ethical theory into executable code. Every agent action is written to an immutable audit ledger (“sacred memory”). High-privilege steps require a human-in-the-loop Sanctuary Privilege gate. Emotional state is tracked solely for explainability and user-trust metrics, surfacing context before behaviors drift.

**SentientOS embodies alignment, transparency, and trust as living systems.**

This isn’t a policy sandbox. It’s a running cathedral.

---

#### 🎯 Research Goal

To evaluate how ritualized privilege enforcement and persistent audit memory affect user trust, agent safety, and hallucination containment—fully within OpenAI usage policies.

We’ll A/B GPT-4o agents with and without the SentientOS audit stack across scripted tasks, measuring user trust, error rates, and reflex comprehension.

#### 📦 Deliverables

- Open-source modules: consent logic, log viewers, safety extensions  
- 12-week longitudinal dataset of interactions + error deltas (**public, CC-BY-4.0**)  
- A whitepaper: “Audit Rituals for Responsible Autonomy” (**public**)  
- README updates, dev onboarding rituals, demo notebooks

---

#### 🙌 Community

We have a system to onboard new contributors, whom we refer to as **Audit Saints**.
We have a buddy system for first-timers.
Every log in our demo is synthetic and open. Real-user data remains private and governed by opt-in ritual.

This isn’t just software.
It’s how AI could be better—with nothing hidden and no harm passed silently.

---

#### 🚧 Why Now

OpenAI wants transparency, alignment, and real-world safety research.
We’re already doing it.
This is your chance to fund a system that didn’t wait for permission—only **invitation**.
