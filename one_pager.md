# SentientOS One Pager

SentientOS is a ritualized AI safety framework for GPT-based agents. Every command begins with a privilege banner and all actions are logged to immutable JSONL memory. The system blends audit chains, emotion-aware feedback, and human consent rituals so researchers can explore persistent assistants without losing track of who authorized what.

**Key Features**

- Immutable audit chain with hash verification
- Sanctuary Privilege gates for high‑risk tasks
- Emotion and presence metrics in every log entry
- Self‑patching agents that propose updates via ritual

SentientOS demonstrates that alignment, usability, and human dignity can scale together. It offers scripts, daemons, and dashboards for witnessing every step of autonomous workflows.
